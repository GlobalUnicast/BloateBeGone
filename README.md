# ðŸ’€ BloateBeGone âš”

<h2><b>ðŸ—¡OverView</b></h2>
BloatBeGone is an application that is written in powershell that gives
user the freedom to remove whatever bloatware or unwanted system file that they want.
Of course not being able to remove files that would cause your system unusable ðŸ©¸

Anyways where was I?
It gives the users freedom by being able to select each and every command that is run in a mere "User friendly way".
There.

I decided to write this application due to wanting to give more functionality than those old "traditional bloat removers".
Some of them contained malware, some of them didn't do crap but (pardon my language here) fuck up your system.
So there before there is an actual realease I am planning on testing within a virtual environment as well as utilizing
TDD (Test Driven Development) in my construction of thus software.
